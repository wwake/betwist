* Click first letter to cancel whole word

* When should we generate the full answer list? now or later? thread?

* Sound

* Tessellations

* New game sets parameters (eg board size)

* iPad is so big it overwhelms our approach to infinite grid [limit size artificially?]


* Rotation animation - can we make it look even better? Should rotation angle be called in completion{}?


Ideas for faster lookup
* Try a 3- or 4-letter prefix dictionary
* Bloom filter - multiple hashes for a probabilistic answer
* Trie
* Performance idea: Generate full list of words for board - with some performance improvements - and use that as the "dictionary"

* Make selection use gradient from first to last letter (ColorChooser would need access to the index position of the selected letter)

* Game modes - as much time as you want, time-limited, find a specific word
* Two-player mode?   (set a seed)

Mirror - top<->bottom, left<->right, diagonal-left <-> diagonal-right
Trigger mirror by shake? [random mirror]
Trigger by swipe from the edge?

Trigger rotation by rotating phone left or right but ignoring rotation back to normal position

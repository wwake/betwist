* Return key submits word ?
* I give up => show me or All Answers
* Make "gimme" words blue
* Message when system didn't find any (extra) words
* All answers => Your Words So Far
* Swap sides so score on right
* Score => Score So Far (or Final Score?)
* Guess in progress near bottom?
* Colors of words - explain?
* Link to dictionary - https://dictionaryapi.dev

* Adjust size of infinite grid  (without rotate buttons) not RotatingGridView - pass geometry down rather than just width

SE: 647x375 -> 1.73 aspect ratio
16: 759x394 -> 1.93 aspect ratio

* Disable "Trie Generation" button

* Animation isn't happening when word is guessed - zIndex issue?

====
* RegularLandscapeView
  - doesn't have animation when word found

* RegularPortraitView
  - doesn't have animation when word found
  - found words pushes the screen down slightly [give it a fixed size?]
  - doesn't fit on iPhone SE

* Use ToastUI framework to briefly pop up score in compact landscape mode [https://www.quanshousio.com/ToastUI]

* Investigate defect where not having a one-pixel padding partially overwrites the safe area ".padding(.top, 1)"

* Load the Trie using Async/Await

* When showing system-found words, show user's words in black
* Link system-found words to a dictionary definition - see api_dictionaryapi_dev/api/v2/entries/en/[the word]


* Tessellations


* New game sets parameters (eg board size)

====

* Sound

* Rotation animation - can we make it look even better? Should rotation angle be called in completion{}?

* Make selection use gradient from first to last letter (ColorChooser would need access to the index position of the selected letter)

Behext? - https://betterprogramming.pub/building-a-hexagonal-grid-with-the-swiftui-layout-protocol-f7b0efeeacbf

* Game modes - as much time as you want, time-limited, find a specific word
* Two-player mode?   (set a seed)

Mirror - top<->bottom, left<->right, diagonal-left <-> diagonal-right
Trigger mirror by shake? [random mirror]
Trigger by swipe from the edge?

Trigger rotation by rotating phone left or right but ignoring rotation back to normal position

* Bigger splashScreen picture to cover ipad
* Better letter generation - use letter dice
* Q => QU [but note you can't spell U-less Q words:)]
* Change end of game - New Game button starts "I give up" -> shows system words, maybe activates a button for that too, and changes the button "New Game" to generate new grid
* CompactPortraitView - On SE, stuff gets pushed off the bottom - try adjusting the frame height of the grid to avoid that - based on the aspect ratio [needs improvement to take rotate buttons into account properly]
